# CombinedParsers.jl Documentation

A package for combining parsers and transforming strings into julia types.

Compose parsers with the functional [parser combinator paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator),
utilize Julia's type inference for transformations,
log conveniently for debugging, and let Julia compile your parser for performance.


!!! note
    `CombinedParsers.jl` is currently an Î± release.	The first official released is prepared for JuliaCon2020.

## Package Features

- Speed
  - [write parsers faster than `Base.PCRE`](man/pcre-compliance.md), optimized by the Julia compiler for parametric parser and state types.
  - `@generated function`s, trie-based scanning ([example](man/example-either-trie.md)), compile with your custom parsing algorithm ([example](man/example-palindromes.md))
  - (planned: memoization, lazy transformations)
- Simplicity
  - Clear [`@syntax`](@ref) integrates [`map`](@ref) transformations with Julia [`result_type`](@ref) inference.
  - Define without redundancy: parser, memory representation, and instance construction.
    When solely the parser is defined, Julia infers [`result_type`](@ref)(parser) and defines memory layout, 
    and constructors are compiled for the parsing state from [`Transformation`](@ref)s.
  - [AbstractTrees.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCollections/AbstractTrees.jl) interface provides clearly layed out printing in the REPL. [`with_log`](@ref) provides colored logging of the parsing [`with_name`](@ref)s.
- Interoperability
  - [TextParse.jl](https://github.com/queryverse/TextParse.jl): existing `TextParse.AbstractToken` implementations can be used with CombinedParsers. `CombinedParser` provide `TextParse.tryparsenext` and can be used e.g. in CSV.jl.
  - Pure Julia regular expression parsers are provided with the [`@re_str`](@ref) macro, a plug-in replacement for `Base.@r_str`.
    Tested on the [PCRE pattern test set](man/pcre-compliance.md).
- Generality
  - All valid parsings can be [`Base.iterate`](@ref)d lazily.
  - Higher-order parsers depending on the parsing state allow for not context-free parsers ([`after`](@ref)).
  - can process UTF8 strings or any sequence type supporting `getindex`, `nextind`, `prevind` methods.


## Getting started
- The [Overview](@ref) provides a tutorial explaining how to get started using CombinedParsers.
The [User guide](man/user.md) provides a summary of CombinedParsers types and constructors.
Some examples of packages using CombinedParsers can be found on the [Examples](@ref) page.
See the [Index](@ref main-index) for the complete list of documented functions and types.

### Example: rational numbers arithmetics
Parsing is reading and transforming a sequence of characters.
`CombinedParsers` provides constructors to combine parsers and transform (sub-)parsings arbitrarily with julia syntax.
```@example session
using CombinedParsers
using TextParse
nothing # hide
```

This example reads and evaluates arithmetical terms for rational numbers.
The following defines an evaluating parser for rational number terms as sequences of subterms interleaved with operators.
```@setup session
function evaluate( (start, operation_values) )
    aggregated_value::Rational{Int} = start
    for (op,val) in operation_values
        aggregated_value = eval( Expr(:call, Symbol(op), 
			              aggregated_value, val
			              ))
    end
    return aggregated_value
end
```
Subterms are [`Either`](@ref) integer numbers, `TextParse.Numeric(Int)` converted to `Rational{Int}`,
or subterms are written as parentheses around a nested term:
```@example session
@syntax subterm = Either{Rational{Int}}(TextParse.Numeric(Int));
@syntax for parenthesis in subterm
    mult         = evaluate |> join(subterm, CharIn("*/"), infix=:prefix )
    @syntax term = evaluate |> join(mult,    CharIn("+-"), infix=:prefix )
    Sequence(2,'(',term,')')
end;
nothing # hide
```
The [`@syntax`](@ref) definition in 5,5 lines is sufficient for parsing and evaluating arithmetics:
[`Base.join`](@ref)`(x,infix; infix=:prefix)` is shorthand for `x `[`*`](@ref)` `[`Repeat`](@ref)`( infix * x  )`,
and `f |> parser` is shorthand for [`map`](@ref)`(f,parser)`.
That's all! [`@syntax`](@ref) registers a `@term_string` macro for parsing and transforming:
```@repl session
result_type(term)
term"(1+2)/5"
# The defined `CombinedParser` `term` function 
# provides optional logging of the parsing process.
term("1/((1+2)*4+3*(5*2))",log = [:parenthesis])
```

Note: The `evaluate` function definition is detailed in [the full example](man/example-arithmetic.md).
```@repl session
evaluate( (0, [ ('+',1), ('-',2) ]) )
evaluate( (1, [ ('*',4), ('/',3) ]) )
```

## Design
The arithmetic parser can be defined without redundancy.
The `CombinedParsers` design 
- infers the Julia data types of the parsing domain with [`result_type`](@ref),
- constructors are compiled for the parsing states,
- is fast due to Julia parametric types, and compiler optimizations with generated functions,
- is composable and optimizable with Julia method dispatch,
- provides flexible public API for parsing, matching, and iteration.

This design is used in several packages of format-parsers transforming texts into nested julia representations.
- OrgmodeParser.jl is a `CombinedParser` for parsing main [org mode](https://orgmode.org/) syntax,
  representing org files within Julia.
- WikitextParser.jl is a `CombinedParser` for parsing [wikitext syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext),
  quite comprehensibly and representing Wikipedia articles within Julia.
- CombinedParserTools.jl is currently more or less my own workspace to provide a set of re-useable parsers.
If you want to work with any of these open source packages, I will gladly provide professional support.
If you are writing your own recursive `CombinedParser` and seek inspiration, you might find these comprehensive examples interesting.
(pre-\alpha, so beware, dragons!)


Making Julia parametric types central for the parser design allows equal automation of the data pipeline after parsing!
- fast db-indexing of text streams (e.g. logging): If you need support indexing logging streams into a (SQL-)Database, the (currently) proprietary TypeGraphs.jl provides `CombinedParsers` plug and play: Table schemas are infered from your parser.
- fast HTTP-serving of parsed data: If you need support with a parsing server-client infrastructure, the (currently) proprietary GraphQLAlchemy.jl provides `CombinedParsers` plug and play: GraphQL schemas and resolver are infered from your parser.
- fast out-of core data science/AI on your parsed data: If you need support with storing parsed data in optimized memory-mapped JuliaDB, TypeDB.jl provides `CombinedParsers` plug and play. 
- fast scientific measurements in a data graph: FilingForest IA.jl provides `CombinedParsers` plug and play: even for recursively nested data.
All (currently) proprietary packages are default-over-configuration for fast integration, and are in active development.

## Optimization Strategy
CombinedParsers.jl is tested against the C PCRE2 library testset.
This strategy also allows for efficient benchmarking of code optimizations on many patterns, and runtime comparison with C PCRE2.
C PCRE2 optimized is among the fastest regex libraries ([second behind Rust](https://github.com/mariomka/regex-benchmark/tree/optimized), running [mariomka](https://github.com/mariomka)'s benchmark will position CombinedParser among its competition.
Explorations for optimization are in git branches.

Depth = 5
```

The package is still young, and optimization is ongoing.
If you are interested in and able to dive deeper into the Julia memory layout and compiler, I would gladly collaborate on further optimizations:
- String layout: Parsing requires repeated Char comparisons. In UTF8, frequent characters are encoded shorter (8 bit), rare have longer codes.
  For this reason, in Julia `String` indices are not consecutive and transversal requires using infamous `nextind` and `prevind`.
  Profiling:
  - `nextind` and `prevind` comsume considerable time.  Could be cached/memoized?
  - `CombinedParsers` currently operates on the result of `getindex(::String,index)::Char` (technically on `iterate(::String,index)::Tuple{Char,Int}`).  Could matching use the raw byte representation directly?
- Macros: make all iteration `@generated` functions using expressions generated by a dispatched `iterate_expression` that can be used in a macro `@iterate` to generate an unrolled/unnested iteration code.
  (Profiling hints that function calls do hardly contribute to runtime.)


## Acknowledgements

This package is enabled only due to the Julia's compiler and superior type system.
Thankfully: a really concise language for powerful computing!


I am thankful for contributions and inspiration from many great packages:
### [TextParse.jl](https://github.com/queryverse/TextParse.jl)
> A bunch of fast text parsing tools, used in CSV.jl

`CombinedParsers` composes with fast
[TextParse.jl](https://github.com/queryverse/TextParse.jl) both ways 
because `CombinedParser <: TextParse.AbstractToken`
and by providing a method for `TextParse.tryparsenext`,
(leveraging the supreme Julia compiler, type and package architecture).

- If you seek support with a dates parser example, please contact me.
- If you seek support with a CSV example, please contact me (e.g. address text field parsing).


```@docs
CombinedParsers.tryparsenext
```

### `CombinedParsers` builds on
- Tries.jl is the abstract implementation of the fast prefix-tree matching in `CombinedParsers` (see [docs](https://gkappler.github.io/CombinedParsers.jl/dev/man/example-either-trie/))
- [AbstractTrees.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCollections/AbstractTrees.jl) interface provides clearly layed out printing in the REPL. [`with_log`](@ref) provides colored logging of the parsing [`with_name`](@ref)s.
### Inspirations
- The work was strongly inspired by the great Scala [fastparse](https://github.com/lihaoyi/fastparse) package, and also the [elm parser](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/parser/latest/).
- [Parsers.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/Parsers.jl), a collection of parsers for date and primitive types, inspired the [`parse`](@ref) methods.
- [Automa.jl](https://github.com/BioJulia/Automa.jl), a Julia package for text validation, parsing, and tokenizing based on state machine compiler.  The package compiles deterministic finite automata.  (Currently there is no inter-operation possible, because in `Automa` processing of parsed tokens is done with actions and UTF8 support is lacking).
- [ParserCombinator.jl](https://github.com/andrewcooke/ParserCombinator.jl) was a great inspiration.
  Yet I decided for a new design with a focus on transformations and type inference with parametric types, instead of basing this work off `ParserCombinator`, written before 2016 (and fixed for Julia 1.0 in 2018).
  `CombinedParsers` integrates into the Julia 1.0 Iteration API, small `Union{Nothing,T} where T` types instead of using Nullables, compiler optimizations and generated functions.
  I want to provide benchmarks comparisons with `ParserCombinator.jl`.
