# CombinedParsers.jl Documentation

```@docs
CombinedParsers
```

Compose parsers parsimoneously within a functional [parser combinator paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator),
utilize Julia's type inference for transformations,
log conveniently for debugging, and let Julia compile your parser for performance.


!!! note
    `CombinedParsers.jl` is currently a release candidate presented at JuliaCon2020.
    See the next steps section, if interested.
	

## Package Features

### Speed

  - optimized julia `@generated function`s for parametric parser and state types (benchmarks in [compliance tests](man/pcre-compliance.md))
  - fast trie-based scanning ([example](man/example-either-trie.md)), compile with your custom parsing algorithm ([example](man/example-palindromes.md))
  - often matches faster than C library `PCRE` regular expressions
  - memoization with [`WithMemory`](@ref)
  - lazy transformations of match states (for [`Sequence`](@ref) and [`Repeat`](@ref))
  
### Simplicity

  - [`@syntax`](@ref) defines parser and result construction without redundancy:
    Julia infers [`result_type`](@ref)(parser) in [`map`](@ref).
  - [AbstractTrees.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCollections/AbstractTrees.jl) printing in the REPL. 
  - [`with_log`](@ref) provides colored logging of the parsing [`with_name`](@ref)s.
  
### Interoperability

  - [TextParse.jl](https://github.com/queryverse/TextParse.jl) can be composed with CombinedParsers and vice versa. 
  - [`@re_str`](@ref) provides pure Julia regular expressions as plug-in replacement for `Base.@r_str`
    ([PCRE pattern unit test set](man/pcre-compliance.md)).

### Generality

  - Lazily [`iterate`](@ref) all valid parsings.
  - Higher-order parsers: [`after`](@ref) matching a left-hand parser a right-hand parser is constructed in arbitrary function of the left-hand match.
  - Parse binary data `Vector{UInt8}` and any sequence type supporting `getindex`, `nextind`, `prevind` methods (cf. [bson example](man/bson.md)).

### Example: rational numbers arithmetics
Parsing is reading and transforming a sequence of characters.
`CombinedParsers` provides constructors to combine parsers and transform (sub-)parsings arbitrarily with julia syntax.
```@example session
using CombinedParsers
using TextParse
nothing # hide
```

This example reads and evaluates arithmetical terms for rational numbers.
The following defines an evaluating parser for rational number terms as sequences of subterms interleaved with operators.
```@setup session
function evaluate( (start, operation_values) )
    aggregated_value::Rational{Int} = start
    for (op,val) in operation_values
        aggregated_value = eval( Expr(:call, Symbol(op), 
			              aggregated_value, val
			              ))
    end
    return aggregated_value
end
```
Subterms are [`Either`](@ref) integer numbers, `TextParse.Numeric(Int)` converted to `Rational{Int}`,
or subterms are written as parentheses around a nested term:
```@example session
@syntax subterm = Either{Rational{Int}}(Any[TextParse.Numeric(Int)]);
@syntax for parenthesis in subterm
    mult         = evaluate |> join(subterm, CharIn("*/"), infix=:prefix )
    @syntax term = evaluate |> join(mult,    CharIn("+-"), infix=:prefix )
    Sequence(2,'(',term,')')
end;
nothing # hide
```
The [`@syntax`](@ref) definition in 5,5 lines is sufficient for parsing and evaluating arithmetics:
[`Base.join`](@ref)`(x, delimiter; infix=:prefix)` is shorthand for [`Sequence`](@ref)`(x ,`[`Repeat`](@ref)`( delimiter * x  ))`,
and `f |> parser` is shorthand for [`map`](@ref)`(f,parser)`.
That's all! [`@syntax`](@ref) registers a `@term_string` macro for parsing and transforming:
```@repl session
result_type(term)
term"(1+2)/5"
# The defined `CombinedParser` `term` function 
# provides optional logging of the parsing process.
term("1/((1+2)*4+3*(5*2))",log = [:parenthesis])
```

Note: The `evaluate` function definition is detailed in [the full example](man/example-arithmetics.md).
```@repl session
evaluate( (0, [ ('+',1), ('-',2) ]) )
evaluate( (1, [ ('*',4), ('/',3) ]) )
```




  

## Useful Design
- [WikitextParser.jl](https://github.com/gkappler/WikitextParser.jl) is a `CombinedParser` for parsing [wikitext syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext),
  quite comprehensibly and representing Wikipedia articles within Julia.
- OrgmodeParser.jl is a `CombinedParser` for parsing main [org mode](https://orgmode.org/) syntax,
  representing org files within Julia.
- [CombinedParserTools.jl](https://github.com/gkappler/CombinedParserTools.jl) is currently more or less my own workspace to provide a set of re-useable parsers, used in `WikitextParser`.
- [Tries.jl](https://github.com/gkappler/Tries.jl) is the abstract implementation of the fast prefix-tree matching in `CombinedParsers` (see [docs](https://gkappler.github.io/CombinedParsers.jl/dev/man/example-either-trie/))
- [ReversedStrings.jl](https://github.com/gkappler/ReversedStrings.jl) implements lazy lazy `String` transformations and `reverse`
  (similar to [LazyArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/LazyArrays.jl))
If you want to work with any of these open source packages, I will gladly provide professional support.
If you are writing your own recursive `CombinedParser` and seek inspiration, you might find these comprehensive examples interesting.
(currently Î± release, so beware, dragons!)

The `CombinedParsers` design 
- is fast due to Julia parametric types, and compiler optimizations with generated functions,
- its strictly typed parsing defines the domain data types,
- is composable and optimizable with Julia method dispatch,
- provides flexible public API for parsing, matching, iteration

Making Julia parametric types central for the parser design equally allows automation of the data pipeline after parsing.

FilingForest demonstrates indexing the German Wiktionary into a columnar database, with fast selecting and measuring.
I am finishing the write-up of Wiktionary data parsing into a language graph database including:
- fast db-indexing of text streams (e.g. logging): If you need support indexing logging streams into a (SQL-)Database, the (currently) proprietary TypeGraphs.jl provides `CombinedParsers` plug and play: Table schemas are infered from your parser.
- fast out-of core data science/AI on your parsed data: If you need support with storing parsed data in optimized memory-mapped JuliaDB, TypeDB.jl provides `CombinedParsers` plug and play. 
- fast scientific measurements in a data graph: FilingForest IA.jl provides `CombinedParsers` plug and play: even for recursively nested data.
All (currently) proprietary packages are default-over-configuration for fast integration, and are in active development.
- fast HTTP-serving of parsed data: If you need support with a parsing server-client infrastructure, the (currently) proprietary GraphQLAlchemy.jl provides `CombinedParsers` plug and play: GraphQL schemas and resolver are infered from your parser.

## Optimization Strategy
With the C PCRE2 library testset, and for 58% of patterns, `CombinedParsers`  match faster than `Regex` (first 100 pattern).
C PCRE2 optimized is among the fastest regex libraries ([second behind Rust](https://github.com/mariomka/regex-benchmark/tree/optimized), running [mariomka](https://github.com/mariomka)'s benchmark will position CombinedParser among its competition).
Explorations for optimization are in git branches.

```

The package is maturing, and optimization is ongoing.
If you are interested in and able to dive deeper into the Julia memory layout and compiler, I would gladly collaborate on further optimizations:
- String layout: Parsing requires repeated Char comparisons. In UTF8, frequent characters are encoded shorter (8 bit), rare have longer codes.
  For this reason, in Julia `String` indices are not consecutive and transversal requires using infamous `nextind` and `prevind`.
  Profiling:
  - `leftof` and `rightof` comsume considerable time.  [`CombinedParsers.NCodeunitsState`](@ref) can speed up that traversal
  - `CombinedParsers` currently operates on the result of `getindex(::String,index)::Char` (technically on `iterate(::String,index)::Tuple{Char,Int}`).  Could matching use the raw byte representation directly?
- Macros: make all iteration `@generated` functions using expressions generated by a dispatched `iterate_expression` that can be used in a macro `@iterate` to generate an unrolled/unnested iteration code.
  (Profiling hints that function calls do hardly contribute to runtime.)



## Acknowledgements

This package is enabled only due to the Julia's compiler and superior type system.
Thankfully: a really concise language for powerful computing!

I am thankful for contributions and inspiration from many great packages:
### [TextParse.jl](https://github.com/queryverse/TextParse.jl)
> A bunch of fast text parsing tools, used in CSV.jl

`CombinedParsers` composes with 
[TextParse.jl](https://github.com/queryverse/TextParse.jl) both ways 
(`CombinedParser <: TextParse.AbstractToken` and provides a method for [`CombinedParsers.tryparsenext`](@ref))


### Inspirations

- The work was strongly inspired by the great Scala [fastparse](https://github.com/lihaoyi/fastparse) package, and also the [elm parser](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/parser/latest/).
- [Parsers.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/Parsers.jl), a collection of parsers for date and primitive types, inspired the [`parse`](@ref) methods.
- [Automa.jl](https://github.com/BioJulia/Automa.jl), a Julia package for text validation, parsing, and tokenizing based on state machine compiler.  The package compiles deterministic finite automata.  (Currently there is no inter-operation possible, because in `Automa` processing of parsed tokens is done with actions).
- [ParserCombinator.jl](https://github.com/andrewcooke/ParserCombinator.jl) was a great inspiration.
  Yet I decided for a new design with a focus on transformations and type inference with parametric types, instead of basing this work off `ParserCombinator`, written before 2016 (and fixed for Julia 1.0 in 2018).
  `CombinedParsers` integrates into the Julia 1.0 Iteration API, small `Union{Nothing,T} where T` types instead of using Nullables, compiler optimizations and generated functions.
  I want to provide benchmarks comparisons with `ParserCombinator.jl`.
